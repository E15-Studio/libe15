![ci status](https://github.com/Simakeng/libe15/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml/badge.svg)

C/C++ Code library mainly designed to implement useful functionalities in code-size sensitive embedded systems such as STM32.

list:

 - `libe15_fpa` - Fixed Point Arithmetic Library


## Fixed Point Arithmetic Library
`libe15_fpa` is a library for fixed point arithmetic. some embedded systems does not contain FPU, so it is handy to have a library to complement this.
